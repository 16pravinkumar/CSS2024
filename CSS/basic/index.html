      CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used to describe
      the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. It defines the
      visual appearance and formatting of elements on a web page, allowing
      developers to control the layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and other design
      aspects of a website. CSS works by selecting HTML elements and applying
      styling rules to them. These rules can be specified inline within the HTML
      document, in a separate style tag within the HTML head, or in an external
      CSS file linked to the HTML. The term "cascading" in CSS refers to the
      priority order of styles, where rules from different sources can conflict,
      and the browser follows a specific order to determine which style to
      apply. CSS provides a powerful and flexible way to create visually
      appealing and responsive web pages, separating the structure and content
      (handled by HTML) from the presentation and styling (handled by CSS).
